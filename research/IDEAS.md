# Candidate hypotheses

Ranked from the RTX 3080 baseline trace; results must be judged by controlled end-to-end decode and combined throughput.

1. PTQ1_0 GEMV dominates the trace. Challenge its sm_86 row/K-block mapping as a coherent kernel investigation, with shape-bucketed full-model benchmarks; prior prefetch and warp-count-only changes were neutral, while alternate side encoding, LUT decoding, and floor-difference decoding were slower.
2. Determine whether PTQ1_0's lower payload is converting into DRAM traffic reduction or whether instruction/occupancy limits dominate. NCU counters are unavailable to this user; use static resources, controlled size sweeps, and end-to-end evidence without changing system counter permissions.
3. Test whether fused Hadamard-to-Q8_1 activation preparation for PQ2_0 recovers its extra transform/quantization kernels; then revisit launch gaps, RMSNorm, and gated-delta recurrent attention after a matvec improvement changes the ranking.
